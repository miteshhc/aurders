aurders is a simple helper for developers to make their packages
ready-to-upload for Arch User Repository.

## What aurders does?

#### aurders handles most of the things one has to do to make their package ready-to-upload on Arch User Repository.

- Generates tarball from source directory.
- Generates PKGBUILD from template.
- Generates .SRCINFO from template.
- Clones repository from aur@aur.archlinux.â€‹org of `pkgname`.
- Adds PKGBUILD, .SRCINFO and source (\*.pkg.tar.zst) to git repository.
- Commits the changes in the git repository.

## What aurders does not do?

#### aurders focuses only on preparing package for upload to Arch User Repository.

- Does NOT create Arch User Repository account or handles anything related to that.
- Does NOT interfere with anything inside the .ssh/ directory.
- Does NOT push-es changes from local git repository.

## Be mindful of following:

- aurders currently supports only one source.
- You can set external source easily, but you are required to have local copy of that same package.
- The PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO templates does not contain all the fields, it contains only what is required and/or is standard.
